    "bigDescription":"Holidaze is a web app for viewing, booking and creating holiday venues. The application communicates with an existing API to handle the venue data. There are two roles to register as; Regular customer and Venue manager. Features: All users can view a list of newest venues, and search for venues by location, dates to be booked and number of guests. All users can view a specific venue by ID, and see the available dates marked on a calendar. Registration: Users with a 'stud.noroff.no' email address can register for the platform; either as a Customer or a Venue manager. For Regular Customers: Can create bookings at other venues made by venue managers. View their upcoming bookings on their profile page. Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image. Login and Logout: Users can securely log in and out of their accounts. For Venue Managers: Create their own venues. Can update and delete a venue they manage. Can view upcoming bookings at a venue they manage in a table on the specific venue page. Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image. View a list of both their own venues and upcoming bookings on the profile page.Reflections & Areas for Improvement: Holidaze was a large and challenging project that pushed me to grow as a frontend developer. One of the most demanding parts was managing both user roles: regular customer and venue manager. This was something I had never done before, but it turned out to be a valuable learning experience that taught me a lot about user flow, conditional rendering, and data handling. I was highly focused on delivering a high-quality result and spent a lot of time refining the details. Everything from layout, responsiveness, and functionality was carefully fine-tuned to ensure a good user experience. If I had more time, I would have loved to expand the site further by adding more pages such as About and Contact. I also see potential in improving the user functionality â€“ for example, allowing users to search for other users and view their profiles.Because I prioritized doing the most essential features well, I didn't have much time to add bonus features. Still, I'm proud of what I accomplished and how much I learned throughout the process.",
