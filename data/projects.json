    "bigDescription": "Bluebid is a bidding website to make bids on items. The website allows users to register, create auction listings, and bid on items using a credit-based system. The application communicates with an existing API to handle auction-related data.",
    "features": "Users with a stud.noroff.no email address can register for the platform, and securely log in and out of their accounts. They can update their avatar to personalize their profile. New users start with 1000 credits, and credits can be earned by selling items and spent by bidding on or purchasing items. Users can add a title, deadline, description, and media gallery for an auction. Users can also place bids on other users' active listings, and see the bids placed on a specific listing. Unregistered users can search for listings, browse and search through available auction listings without registering.",
    "reflectionsAndImprovements":"This project was a learning process, with many new features I had not implemented before. It helped me learn more and it challenged me. If I had more time, I would spend more time adding more user friendly visuals, like toast notifications, better loading visibility and more detailed error messages. It could also benefit from adding unit tests. It could also be improved by adding TypeScript for a better developer experience and stronger type-safety. After reviewing the project again, I have added some improvements by including more formdata validation.",

    "bigDescription":"Next Level Goods is an online store created with React and TypeScript that allows users to register and log in, browse and search for items, add items to the cart and proceed to checkout. The home page displays product cards in a grid, so that the user can view important aspects of the products; image, name, short description, price, price on sale, rating and a link to the specific product page.",
    "features":"It includes a responsive navigation bar which features a hamburger menu for mobile screens and a shopping cart icon that dynamically updates the cart item count based on localStorage data. It listens for a custom event (cartUpdated) to dynamically update the cart count. When going to shopping cart, the users get to view the products added to the cart and the calculated total of the products. It uses styled-components for styling.",
    "reflectionsAndImprovements":"When looking back at my code now and if I had more time, I would add JS docs to properly document my code. I would use prettier, eslint and husky to format my code, so that all code is neatly formatted and organized, and make sure there are no unnecessary spaces in the code, which is important. I would also make sure there are no unused variables in the code. I would remove all console.logs and make sure that all errors are visible and clear for the users, by focusing on detailed and visible errors and implement toast notifications. By now, I have already made some improvements on the project code, and I have added eslint, prettier and husky.",

It is for viewing, booking and creating holiday venues. The application communicates with an existing API to handle the venue data.

    "features": "All users can view a list of newest venues, and search for venues by location, dates to be booked and number of guests. All users can view a specific venue by ID, and see the available dates marked on a calendar. Registration: Users with a 'stud.noroff.no' email address can register for the platform; either as a Customer or a Venue manager. For Regular Customers: Can create bookings at other venues made by venue managers. View their upcoming bookings on their profile page. Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image. Login and Logout: Users can securely log in and out of their accounts. For Venue Managers: Create their own venues. Can update and delete a venue they manage. Can view upcoming bookings at a venue they manage in a table on the specific venue page. Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image. View a list of both their own venues and upcoming bookings on the profile page.",
    "reflectionsAndImprovements": "This was a large and challenging project that pushed me to grow as a frontend developer. One of the most demanding parts was managing both user roles: regular customer and venue manager. This was something I had never done before, but it turned out to be a valuable learning experience that taught me a lot about user flow, conditional rendering, and data handling. I was highly focused on delivering a high-quality result and everything from layout, responsiveness, and functionality was carefully fine-tuned to ensure a good user experience. If I had more time, I would expand the site further by adding more pages such as About and Contact. I also see potential in improving the user functionality â€“ for example, allowing users to search for other users and view their profiles. I would also use TypeScript instead of vanilla JavaScript. Because I prioritized doing the most essential features well, I didn't have much time to add other features. Still, I'm proud of what I accomplished and how much I learned throughout the process.",
